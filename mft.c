/*
â€“> MFT (Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks) is one of the old memory
management techniques in which the memory is partitioned into fixed size partitions and
each job is assigned to a partition. The memory assigned to a partition does not change.
Memory is divided into several fixed-size partitions.Each partition may contain exactly one
process/task.Boundaries for partitions are set at boot time and arenot movable.An input
queue per partition.The degree of multiprogramming is bound by the number of partitions. */
